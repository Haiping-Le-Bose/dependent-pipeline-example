# Buildkite Dependent Pipeline Example

[![Add to Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/button.svg)](https://buildkite.com/new)

This repository is an example [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) that shows how to trigger another dependent build pipeline using the [Create Build API](https://buildkite.com/docs/api/builds#create-a-build), both asynchronously (its build status will not affect this build) and synchronously (its build status will affect this build).
